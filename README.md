## 📖 About the Project

This is my Professional Elective 2 personal project — a role-based MOA management platform built for New Era University.

MOAs (Memoranda of Agreement) are formal partnership agreements between NEU and external companies that open up internship and training opportunities for students. Before this system, those records lived in spreadsheets — no visibility on expiring agreements, no audit trail, no way for students to browse available partners. This application fixes all of that.

There is a full admin and faculty side for managing the complete MOA lifecycle (from initial processing through signing, active use, expiry, and renewal), and a student-facing view where OJT students can browse approved partner companies filtered by industry.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why I used it |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | React 18 + Vite 5 | Fast dev server, component-based UI |
| Routing | React Router DOM v6 | Protected routes with role-based guards |
| Auth | Firebase Authentication | Email/password with NEU domain enforcement |
| Database | Cloud Firestore | Real-time NoSQL with sub-collections for audit trail |
| Hosting | Firebase Hosting | Free, fast, deploys in one command |
| Charts | Recharts 2 | Composable chart components for statistics dashboard |
| Styling | Inline CSS (dark design system) | Consistent dark UI, zero CSS framework overhead |

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- A Firebase project with Email/Password Auth and Firestore enabled

### Steps

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EranJosh/NEU-MOA-Monitor.git
cd NEU-MOA-Monitor
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables**

Copy the example file and fill in your Firebase credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Your `.env` should look like this (get values from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Apps):
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

**4. Start the dev server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Sign in with an `@neu.edu.ph` account.

**5. Seed the database** *(optional — loads 21 demo MOA records)*

Log in as an Admin and click the **Seed Database** button on the Dashboard. This populates realistic sample data across all 8 statuses, 5 industries, and multiple colleges.

> ⚠️ Seeding is additive — click once only, or reset before re-seeding.

## 📦 Deploying

This project uses Firebase Hosting. After making changes:

```bash
# Build the production bundle
npm run build

# Deploy hosting and Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only hosting,firestore:rules
```

> The `.env` file must be present before building — Vite embeds all `VITE_` variables into the bundle at build time.
